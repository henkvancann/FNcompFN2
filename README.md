[TO THE COMPARISON TABLE](./FNcompGordian.md)

## Why relevant?
FN was first. Then BlockchainCommons and @Fonta1n3 invented a spin-off, which is now called Gordian Wallet.<br/>
And Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet are two other competing wallets to benchmark against.

## Naming
The names used to be very similar, FN and FN2, but their objectives were always different, which gratefully led to a divergent naming, July 2020: *Fully Noded* versus *Gordian Wallet* <br/>
The creator of FullyNoded, @Fonta1n3, develops and maintains both iOS apps. Gordian Wallet and Fully Noded.

## Objective?
This analysis provides an overview of the most advanced wallets, their funcionality, strengths and weaknesses. It has mainly served an educational purpose: it's been a way to learn about wallets, tor, connections to nodes, multisignatures, airgapped, transfer of keys, etc.

## And you?
Hope you find differences and similarities at a glance. And get to know what they all have in common. Beware that is a snapshot in time. Now Aug-Sept 2020.
